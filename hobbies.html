<body><h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I have a few hobbies that I'm really passionate about. I love going to the gym to stay fit and challenge myself physically. I also enjoy riding my motorcycle; there's something freeing about it that I really appreciate. Photography is another passion of mineâ€”I love capturing moments and expressing my creativity through images. Fashion is a big interest for me, too; I enjoy staying up to date with trends and expressing myself through my style. Lastly, I collect shoes, which combines my love for fashion and unique designs. Each pair has a story, and I love the hunt for special additions to my collection!</p>
